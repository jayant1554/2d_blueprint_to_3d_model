Convert your 2D architectural blueprints into stunning 3D models with ease!

![3D Model Example](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png?text=3D+Model+Example)

## 🌟 Features

- **Accurate Conversion**: Transform 2D blueprints into precise 3D models
- **Multiple Input Formats**: Support for various 2D blueprint file types
- **Customizable Output**: Generate 3D models in popular formats like OBJ, FBX, and GLTF
- **Texture Mapping**: Automatically apply textures for a realistic finish
- **Cloud Processing**: Leverage cloud resources for faster processing of large blueprints

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jayant1554/2d_blueprint_to_3d_model.git
   cd 2d_blueprint_to_3d_model
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the conversion script**
   ```
   python convert.py path/to/your/blueprint.jpg
   ```

4. **Find your 3D model in the `output` directory**

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
